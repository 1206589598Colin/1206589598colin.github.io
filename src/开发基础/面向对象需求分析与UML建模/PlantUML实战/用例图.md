# 用例图

## 用例

 `定义用例`

 `方法一：`

    使用()包裹用例名

 `方法二：`

    使用关键字 usecase 用来定义用例

 `使用关键字 as 定义用例别名`

``` 

(First usercase)
(Another usercase) as (US2)

usecase UC3
usecase (Last\nusecase) as UC4
```

``` plantuml
(First usercase)
(Another usercase) as (US2)

usecase UC3
usecase (Last\nusecase) as UC4
```

## 角色

 `定义角色`

 `方式一：`

    使用冒号包裹起来

 `方式二：`

    使用关键字actor来定义

 `使用关键字as来定义一个别名`

``` 

:First Actor:
:Another actor:

actor Woman3
actor :Last actor: as Person1
```

``` plantuml
:First Actor:
:Another actor:

actor Woman3
actor :Last actor: as Person1
```

## 改变角色的样式

可以将角色的样式从默认的火柴人改成：

*   用户头像样式：`skinparam actorStyle awesome`
*   透明人样式：`skinparam actorStyle hollow`

``` 

skinparam actorStyle awesome
:User: --> (Use)
"Main Admin" as Admin
"Use the application" as (Use)
Admin --> (Admin the application)
```

``` plantuml
skinparam actorStyle awesome
:User: --> (Use)
"Main Admin" as Admin
"Use the application" as (Use)
Admin --> (Admin the application)
```

``` 

skinparam actorStyle Hollow 
:User: --> (Use)
"Main Admin" as Admin
"Use the application" as (Use)
Admin --> (Admin the application)
```

``` plantuml
skinparam actorStyle Hollow 
:User: --> (Use)
"Main Admin" as Admin
"Use the application" as (Use)
Admin --> (Admin the application)
```

## 用例描述

 `如果想定义跨越多行的用例描述，可以用双引号将其裹起来。`

还可以使用这些分隔符：

*   `--`（横线）
*   `..`（虚线）
*   `==`（双横线）
*   `__`（下划线）

并且还可以在分隔符中间放置标题。

``` 

usecase UC1 as "You can use
several lines to define your usecase.
You can also use separators.
--
Several separators are possible.
==
And you can add titles:
..Conclusion..
This allows large description."
```

``` plantuml
usecase UC1 as "You can use
several lines to define your usecase.
You can also use separators.
--
Several separators are possible.
==
And you can add titles:
..Conclusion..
This allows large description."
```

## 使用包

 `您可以一使用包来对角色或用例进行分组`

``` plantuml
left to right direction
actor Guest as g

package Professional{
    actor Chef as c
    actor "Food Critic" as f
}

package Restaurant{
    (Eat Food) as ef
    (Pay for Food) as pff
    (Drink) as d
    (Review) as r
}

g --> ef
g --> pff
g --> d
f --> r
```

 `您可以使用rectangle来改变包的外观`

``` 

left to right direction
actor "Food Critic" as fc

rectangle Restaurant{
    (Eat Food) as ef
    (Pay for Food) as pff
    (Drink) as d
}

fc --> ef
fc --> pff
fc --> d
```

``` plantuml
left to right direction
actor "Food Critic" as fc

rectangle Restaurant{
    (Eat Food) as ef
    (Pay for Food) as pff
    (Drink) as d
}

fc --> ef
fc --> pff
fc --> d
```

## 基础示例

* `使用箭头->来连接角色和用例，横杆-越多，箭头越长`

``` 

actor User
(Start) as s
(Use the application) as uta
actor "Main Admin" as ma

User -> s
User --> uta : A small lable
ma ---> uta :This is\nyet another\nlable

```

``` plantuml
actor User
(Start) as s
(Use the application) as uta
actor "Main Admin" as ma

User -> s
User --> uta : A small lable
ma ---> uta :This is\nyet another\nlable

```

## 继承

 `如果一个角色或用例继承另一个，那么可以用<|--符号表示`

``` 

: User : as User
: Main Admin : as ma

User <|-- ma 

(Start) as start
(Use the application) as uta
start <|-- uta

```

``` plantuml
: User : as User
: Main Admin : as ma

User <|-- ma 

(Start) as start
(Use the application) as uta
start <|-- uta

```

## 使用注释

 `可以使用note left of, note rigth of, note top of ,note buttom of 等关键字给对象添加注释`

 `注释还可以通过note关键字来定义，然后用.. 连接其他对象。`

``` 

: User : as user
: Main Admin : as ma

(Start) as start 
(Use the application) as uta

user -> start 
user ---> uta
ma ---> uta

note right of ma : This is an example
note right of uta
A note can also
be on serveral lines
end note
note "This note is connected\nto serveral objects." as N2
start .. N2
N2 .. user
```

``` plantuml
: User : as user
: Main Admin : as ma

(Start) as start 
(Use the application) as uta

user -> start 
user ---> uta
ma ---> uta

note right of ma : This is an example
note right of uta
A note can also
be on serveral lines
end note
note "This note is connected\nto serveral objects." as N2
start .. N2
N2 .. uta
```

## 构造类型

 `用 << 和 >> 来定义角色或者用例的构造类型`

``` 

User << Human >> as user
"Main Database" << Application >> as md

(Start) <<One shot>> as os
(Use the application) <<Main>> as uta

user -> os
user --> uta
md --> uta
```

``` plantuml
User << Human >> as user
"Main Database" << Application >> as md

(Start) <<One shot>> as os
(Use the application) <<Main>> as uta

user -> os
user --> uta
md --> uta
```

## 改变箭头方向

 `默认连接是竖直方向的，用--表示，可以用一个横杠或点来表示水平连接。`

``` plantuml
: user : as user
(Use case 1) as uc1
(Use case 2) as uc2

user -> uc1
user --> uc2
```

 `通过翻转箭头来改变方向`

``` plantuml
: user : as user
(Use case 1) as uc1
(Use case 2) as uc2

uc1 <.. user
uc2 <- user
```

 `还可以通过给箭头添加left, right, up或down等关键字来改变方向`

``` 

:user: as user
(dummyLeft) as dummyLeft
(dummyRight) as dummyRight
(dummyUp) as dummyUp
(dummyDown) as dummyDown

user -left-> dummyLeft
user -right-> dummyRight
user -up-> dummyUp
user -down-> dummyDown

```

``` plantuml
:user: as user
(dummyLeft) as dummyLeft
(dummyRight) as dummyRight
(dummyUp) as dummyUp
(dummyDown) as dummyDown

user -left-> dummyLeft
user -right-> dummyRight
user -up-> dummyUp
user -down-> dummyDown

```

## 分割图示

 `newpage关键字将图示分解为多个页面`

``` 

: actor1 : as actor1
(Usercase1) as uc1

actor1 --> uc1
newpage

: actor2 : as actor2
(Usercase2) as uc2
actor2 --> uc2

```

``` plantuml
: actor1 : as actor1
(Usercase1) as uc1

actor1 --> uc1
newpage

: actor2 : as actor2
(Usercase2) as uc2
actor2 --> uc2

```

## 从左向右方向

 `你可以用left to right direction命令改变图示方向`

``` 

left to right direction
user1 --> (Usecase 1)
user2 --> (Usecase 2)
```

``` plantuml
left to right direction
user1 --> (Usecase 1)
user2 --> (Usecase 2)
```

## 显示参数

用[skinparam](https://plantuml.com/zh/skinparam)改变字体和颜色。可以在如下场景中使用：

*   在图示的定义中，
*   [在引入的文件中](https://plantuml.com/zh/preprocessing)，
*   在[命令行](https://plantuml.com/zh/command-line)或者[ANT任务](https://plantuml.com/zh/ant-task)提供的配置文件中。

你也可以给构造的角色和用例指定特殊颜色和字体。

``` 

skinparam handwritten true

skinparam usecase {
BackgroundColor DarkSeaGreen
BorderColor DarkSlateGray

BackgroundColor<< Main >> YellowGreen
BorderColor<< Main >> YellowGreen

ArrowColor Olive
ActorBorderColor black
ActorFontName Courier

ActorBackgroundColor<< Human >> Gold
}

User << Human >>
:Main Database: as MySql << Application >>
(Start) << One Shot >>
(Use the application) as (Use) << Main >>

User -> (Start)
User --> (Use)

MySql --> (Use)
```

``` plantuml
skinparam handwritten true

skinparam usecase {
BackgroundColor DarkSeaGreen
BorderColor DarkSlateGray

BackgroundColor<< Main >> YellowGreen
BorderColor<< Main >> YellowGreen

ArrowColor Olive
ActorBorderColor black
ActorFontName Courier

ActorBackgroundColor<< Human >> Gold
}

User << Human >>
:Main Database: as MySql << Application >>
(Start) << One Shot >>
(Use the application) as (Use) << Main >>

User -> (Start)
User --> (Use)

MySql --> (Use)
```

## 一个完整的例子

``` 

: customer : as customer
: clerk : as clerk

rectangle checkout{
    (payment) as payment
    (checkout) as checkout1
    (help)  as help
    
    checkout1 -up.> payment : incluce
    help -up.> checkout1 : exentds
}

customer - checkout1
checkout1 - clerk

```

``` plantuml

: customer : as customer
: clerk : as clerk

rectangle checkout{
    (payment) as payment
    (checkout) as checkout1
    (help)  as help
    
    checkout1 -up.> payment : incluce
    help -up.> checkout1 : exentds
}

customer - checkout1
checkout1 - clerk

```

## 业务用例

``` 

(First usecase)/
(Another usecase)/ as (UC2)
usecase/ UC3
usecase/ (Last\nusecase) as UC4
```

``` plantuml
(First usecase)/
(Another usecase)/ as (UC2)
usecase/ UC3
usecase/ (Last\nusecase) as UC4
```

## 商业角色

``` 

:First Actor:/
:Another\nactor:/ as Man2
actor/ Woman3
actor/ :Last actor: as Person1
```

``` plantuml
:First Actor:/
:Another\nactor:/ as Man2
actor/ Woman3
actor/ :Last actor: as Person1
```

## 更改箭头的颜色和样式（内联样式）

您可以使用以下内联符号更改单个箭头的[颜色](https://plantuml.com/zh/color)或样式：

*   `#color;line.[bold|dashed|dotted];text:color`

``` 

actor foo
foo --> (bar) : normal
foo --> (bar1) #line:red;line.bold;text:red  : red bold
foo --> (bar2) #green;line.dashed;text:green : green dashed 
foo --> (bar3) #blue;line.dotted;text:blue   : blue dotted
```

``` plantuml
actor foo
foo --> (bar) : normal
foo --> (bar1) #line:red;line.bold;text:red  : red bold
foo --> (bar2) #green;line.dashed;text:green : green dashed 
foo --> (bar3) #blue;line.dotted;text:blue   : blue dotted
```

## 更改元素的颜色和样式（内联样式）

您可以使用以下符号更改单个元素的[颜色](https://plantuml.com/zh/color)或样式：

*   `#[color|back:color];line:color;line.[bold|dashed|dotted];text:color`

``` 

actor a
actor b #pink;line:red;line.bold;text:red
usecase c #palegreen;line:green;line.dashed;text:green
usecase d #aliceblue;line:blue;line.dotted;text:blue
```

``` plantuml
actor a
actor b #pink;line:red;line.bold;text:red
usecase c #palegreen;line:green;line.dashed;text:green
usecase d #aliceblue;line:blue;line.dotted;text:blue
```
